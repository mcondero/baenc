# base64 encoder (baenc)

This is my base64 encoder written in Go. It was designed for base64 encoding for basic authentication inside API protocols. I've created it based in a sequence of shell commands developed by a coworker. The purpose of this repository is for exercise only.

## usage

You run 'baenc' binary and type the user and password you want to base64 encode. The final output is your base64 string that you will use inside your API calls.
